# Optimizing Dead Mileage in Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation

 •	The public road transportation plays an important role in mobility of people in metropolitan cities. In most of the state in India, the road transport service is undertaken by the government, and it involves large amount of investment for providing facilities for maintenance, parking, and operation of routes. This is done by construction of depots, bus stations, and bus stop shelters.

•	The depot is the main operating unit in any public road transportation where the buses are parked and maintained. The bus must travel from depot to route starting point to operate route as depot and route starting point at different places.

•	In early days, dead kilometers percentage was minimum as operation of buses are very less compared with the present days and such problems were solved based on common sense and experience. But at present, the kilometers operated by public transportation is in terms of lakhs of kilometers, and the amount of fuel consumption is very high, which cannot be neglected. The dead kilometers not only result in revenue loss but also causes an increase in operating cost as it involves more fuel consumption, crew overtime, and increase in maintenance cost because of the extra distance covered by the buses.

•	Therefore, the dead kilometers reduction is important for economic growth of the public road transport service.
